## Important notes

#### app.js

This is where the magic happens. your app starts here

#### app.css

This is where all the CSS for an app goes. Try to refrain from styling an app directly
in the JS whenever possible.

#### install.json

This is where all the <a href="https://eager.io/developer/docs/install-json">options are added for the app</a>. <a href="http://install.json.is/">Syntax can be tricky</a>, so be sure to double check it

http://install.json.is/

#### Additional notes

- <a href="https://eager.io/developer/docs/getting-started">Reading the docs</a> tends to help more than you'd think.
- Make sure to prefix any classes and div's with `eager`, like shown in this app.
