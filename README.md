# Example Babel App

*Get going with Eager!*

This is our example app with Babel support. In order to get babel installed for this
project, run the setup command in CLI in the root directory of this project, and
get it running with the usage commands below.

## Setup

`npm install`

## Usage

* `npm run watch:js`: Watch for Javascript changes an compile them.

* `npm run watch:css`: Watch for CSS changes an compile them.

## Important notes

#### app.js

App.js is where all of the Javascript code goes. There's comments inside the files
explaining all the important parts.

#### app.css

This is where all the CSS for an app goes. Try to refrain from styling an app directly
in the JS whenever possible.

#### install.json

This is where all the options are added for the app. For a better explanation on how
to add options and how json's work, check these sources below.
